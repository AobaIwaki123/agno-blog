# Conda Environment Rule

## Required Environment Setup

**ALWAYS** activate the `agno` conda environment before running any Python commands or scripts in this project.

### Commands to run:
```bash
conda activate agno
```

### When to apply:
- Before running any Python scripts
- Before starting the development server
- Before running tests
- Before installing Python packages
- Before any Python-related terminal commands

### Example usage patterns:
```bash
# Starting the application
conda activate agno && cd src && python main.py

# Running tests
conda activate agno && python test_agent_implementation.py

# Installing packages
conda activate agno && pip install package-name
```

### Environment details:
- Environment name: `agno`
- Python version: 3.12
- Contains all required dependencies for the Agno framework
- Required for proper import resolution and package availability

### Why this is important:
1. The `agno` package and its dependencies are only available in this conda environment
2. Python path configuration is set up correctly in this environment
3. All project dependencies are isolated in this environment
4. Prevents conflicts with system Python or other projects

**Remember: Never run Python commands without first activating the agno environment!**
